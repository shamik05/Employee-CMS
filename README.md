## Description
This is a **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems focused-application for managing a company's employee database. It's built with a node interface and uses the inquirer npm package to communicate to a mysql backend. The results are then displayed using the console.table npm package. It has three major components (tables) in the database - Employees, Roles and Departments. Each management table consists of its own views, adding, removing and updating functions which the user has complete control over. The schema files in the sql folder can be consulted to find a detailed database structure.
